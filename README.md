# Topic-Modelling-and-Sentiment-Analysis-Yelp-Reviews
Provide more aspects of Yelp's reviews ratings by applying LDA topic modelling and VADER sentiment analysis techniques

1. INTRODUCTION

Yelp is a business directory service that hosts crowd sourced reviews of businesses founded in 2004, San Francisco. The types of businesses include restaurants, cafes, health centres, retail outlets. etc. Yelp is business-to-consumer application where Yelp users can submit reviews using a rating system. Moreover, users can submit written reviews about the businesses that helps other users make informed decision about products/ services. Our focus, through the course of this project, will be restaurants and the F&B businesses and study reviews and the nature of reviews. 

Yelp users and businesses encounter several pain points that can be addressed with text mining solutions. Firstly, on Yelp, businesses only have 1 consolidated rating, but no rating into the specific aspects of the business, such as Ambience, service or food etc. This means that as a user, I will not be able to filter reviews relevant to the aspect or find out specifics to the restaurant. As a business, it is difficult for me to understand which aspects the business can improve on when they have a low rating. Therefore, the motivation is to alleviate these pain points with topic modelling and sentiment analysis.
